				How on earth could this be art? You scratch your head as you hear an old man behind you mutter something about degenerates. Okay, so maybe you’re not that angry about the piece, but nevertheless, you’re perplexed, if not a bit upset.
			</p><br>
			<p class= "scroll-fadeinup-once hidden">
				You want to engage, but there’s so little to engage with. It’s not like you don’t have any idea what good art looks like. In the Renaissance and Romantic exhibits, you can marvel at the skill and artistry necessary to craft gorgeous life-like pieces. But once Modernism hits, you begin to break into a sweat.
			</p><br>
			<p class= "scroll-fadeinup-once hidden">
				Perhaps, like fine wine, art has been left to the elites to enjoy and define what is “good.” Perhaps it’s a lost cause. Or, perhaps, like the classic children’s fable The Emperor’s New Clothes, we’re all playing along to a cruel joke, waiting for some child to come along and make clear that we’re all delusional. 
			</p><br>
			<p class= "scroll-fadeinup-once hidden">
				All of these points are valid, and many of them are partially true. But if the goal here is to better understand the artwork we see in museums, our homes, and on our bustling city streets, it might be helpful to keep an open mind and see if we can glean something from art as it exists today. 
			</p><br>
			<p class= "scroll-fadeinup-once hidden">
				The term art has come to encompass so many diverse and exciting fields that it would be impossible to cover it all in an article, so for now let’s focus our attention primarily on visual art, although the concepts we explore here will extend to other forms of art as well. 
			</p><br>
			<p class= "scroll-fadeinup-once hidden">
				In this article, I’m going to introduce three different ways of looking at art. While not all encompassing, they’re a good first step in being able to enjoy, and possibly even engage, with the art world around us.

			<p class= "scroll-fadeinup-once hidden">
				Ah, something familiar! We’re all well-versed in the concept of art as a representation of visual perception. Take the Mona Lisa, for example. It’s easy to see that the piece is a work of art. The amount of detail and realism in every square inch of the painting is remarkable, to say the least.
			</p><br>
			<p class= "scroll-fadeinup-once hidden">
				But perhaps art represents more than meets the eye. As participants and sometimes even instigators of history, art and history are inevitably related. You can’t have one without another. Artists, and the art they produce, are a reflection of the times they lived in. In this way, art tells a story, not only about the narrative which may be present in the canvas, but also the history surrounding it, and the time in which it existed. 
			</p><br>

				</div>
				<h3><i>Bridge over a Pond of Water Lilies</i>, Claude Monet</h3>
			</div>
			
			<p class= "scroll-fadeinup-once hidden">
				A great example of this is the Impressionist Movement. If you look at this piece by Monet (often cited as “the Father of Impressionism”), you might be perplexed. Compared to the art that came before, it seems like art has taken a step back from realism. Some of his pieces are blurry, and almost shimmer, as if your eyes can’t focus on a single part of the painting. How do we appreciate art like this?
			</p><br>
			<p class= "scroll-fadeinup-once hidden">
				Here, looking at art as a representation of its historical context can clue us in and fill some gaps. Just before the Impressionist Movement hit its stride, the camera was invented. Artists began to fear that they would no longer be necessary- after all, why pay for an expensive portrait when you could just get a photograph? Impressionists like Monet began to experiment with paint to see how they could depict light, color, and movement in a way that photographs at the time (and indeed, even today) could not. Suddenly, Monet’s paintings of shimmering ponds and hazy evenings doesn’t seem like so much of a mystery anymore.
			</p><br>
			<p class= "scroll-fadeinup-once hidden">
				Perhaps you now understand why Monet painted in the style he did, but you don’t like it. Which is totally fine! But if the reason you don’t like his art is solely because it fails to accurately represent real life, I have some bad news for you. 
			</p><br>

				<h3><i>The Creation of Adam</i>, Michelangelo</h3>
			</div>
			<p class= "scroll-fadeinup-once hidden">
				Take the piece above, The Creation of Adam, by Michelangelo. This piece, gorgeous as it is, is in no way realistic. I can say with near-certainty that Michelangelo never saw this scene play out before his eyes. It, too, is a representation of its historical context, signaling the power of the church at the time and the rise of humanism (see the obvious shape of the brain formed by God’s cape). The piece tells a story, depicting a scene that could never have been observed by the artist himself. 
			</p><br>
			<p class= "scroll-fadeinup-once hidden">
				In this way, all art is an illusion, a trick of the light- which hints at something underlying which is real. No artist who strives to depict reality as it is will ever be able to capture every part of the thing he or she is trying to depict. And nowhere was this clearer than the example of the photograph, where in a literal flash, artists realized that their work would never be good enough as the real thing.
			</p><br>
			<p class= "scroll-fadeinup-once hidden">
				After the photograph was invented, artists searched for new ways to depict the world around them. It may be confusing and even frustrating to look at art post-invention-of-the-photograph, but it is reassuring to know that art will always be a representation of the context in which it was created, and in which it persists.

				If artists couldn’t just depict what they saw, what on earth would they do? Cue, expression.
			</p><br>
			<p class= "scroll-fadeinup-once hidden">
				Artists have long had a love-hate relationship with expression. Depending on the period of time, you’ll find art which is overtly emotional (see: Romanticism) or art which is rigid and analytical (see: Neoclassicism). But try as they might, artists could never escape the fact that art, emotional or analytical, was an expression of the artist.

				</div>
				<h3><i>The Scream</i>, Edvard Munch</h3>
			</div>
			
			<p class= "scroll-fadeinup-once hidden">
				Few paintings depict the relationship between expression and art better than Edvard Munch’s The Scream. The piece is terrifying, even horrendous to look at, and it depicts what many historians theorize was one of Munch’s psychotic episodes. The bleeding sky and the swirling lines make the piece sickening to look at, almost making the viewer feel the way Munch must have felt at the time
			</p><br>
			<p class= "scroll-fadeinup-once hidden">
				Many artists will tell you that art is, in many ways, not a conscious choice. Artists will have a tendency to approach a project and emerge, hours or days later with a product that is as much their work as it is the work of their subconscious. Indeed, when I make my own pieces I can get lost for hours at a time without realizing it. 
			</p><br>
			<p class= "scroll-fadeinup-once hidden">
				As art became more expressive into the 20th and 21st century, the artwork displayed in the galleries became more the symptom than the source. This is precisely why, were I to paint an identical copy of The Scream, it wouldn’t be nearly as meaningful. The value of the art is in the fact that it was symptomatic of the art that lies within. 
			</p><br>
			<div class="content-container col-xs-12 img-responsive scroll-fadeinup-once hidden" style= "padding-left: 0%; padding-right: 0%; min-height: 0">

				<h3><i>Guernica</i>, Pablo Picasso</h3>
			</div>
			<p class= "scroll-fadeinup-once hidden">
				And expression doesn’t necessarily need to be subconscious, either. Artists can consciously insert symbolism or meaning into their works, provoking thought, or even action. Take the piece Guernica, by Pablo Picasso. It depicts a brutal scene of trauma and distress, in response to the bombing of the town of Guernica in Spain. 
			</p><br>
			<p class= "scroll-fadeinup-once hidden">
				Countless critiques have theorized the symbolic representations of each piece of the painting. Perhaps the lightbulb represents the Sun. The flattening of linear perspective, an intentional choice to give the viewer access to different perspectives at once. The bull and horse, significant to Spanish culture, may represent Spain or the wild and animalistic nature of war. But how much of this symbolism can we credit to Picasso? After all, the man himself said “this bull is a bull and this horse is a horse.”
			</p><br>
			<p class= "scroll-fadeinup-once hidden">
				How much of artistic expression can we credit to the artist, and how much of it is utter nonsense? If we are to look at a piece by its expressiveness, how are we to know whether it is thoughtful expression or just our projections of our own interpretation? This brings us to the third and final way we will explore looking at art.

			<p class= "scroll-fadeinup-once hidden">
				Suppose you were at a cocktail party sipping on your favorite non-alcoholic beverage (you’re the designated driver, because of course), talking with friends about a topic that appealed to you. You walk away for a few moments and return, only to find out that your friends have moved on to a different topic of conversation altogether. Confused and slightly distressed, you conclude that their new conversation is worthless because you don’t understand it. Is that fair?
			</p><br>
			
			<img class= "removed mobile-only scroll-fadeinup-once hidden" src= "blogimages/starry-night-van-gogh.jpg" style= "width: 100%; padding-bottom: 20px" alt= "placeholder" align= "right">
			<h3 class= "removed mobile-only scroll-fadeinup-once hidden"><i>The Starry Night</i>, Vincent Van Gogh</h3>
			
			<p class= "scroll-fadeinup-once hidden">
				This is, I think, a good characterization for where art is today. Contemporary artists, who have thoroughly studied art history and are caught up on the conversation, are building on the existing dialogues created by fellow contemporaries, while the common museum-goer is left in the dust. Many of us left the conversation long ago, somewhere in the Renaissance, and only now are returning to find that the conversation (the styles, methods, and meanings) surrounding art have radically changed- an undeniably uncomfortable feeling! While I personally believe that artists can do more to bring interested audiences up-to-speed with art, I also believe that anyone can use their own tools and understanding to appreciate art in their own way, as long as they keep an open mind. In this way, art and art history truly is a conversation. 
			</p><br>
			
			<p class= "scroll-fadeinup-once hidden">
				Let’s return to the question where we left off- if we can’t tell the difference between what the artist intended and what we see in a painting, how do we know if a piece of art is good? 
			</p><br>
			<p class= "scroll-fadeinup-once hidden">
				I think it’s important to get rid of this fixation with the artist’s intent and the quality of the work the artist produces. After all, I could intend on producing the next great American novel without succeeding (likely), and I could write a profound poem on accident (less likely). Still, there’s something a bit unnerving about giving credit where it doesn’t feel like it was earned, or even intentional. 
			</p><br>

			</div>
			
			<p class= "scroll-fadeinup-once hidden">
				But perhaps art is more than just the piece, or the artist. Perhaps in viewing the art, you are, in some way, a part of it too. If art is a conversation, then we must judge art based on what makes for a worthwhile conversation. If I were chatting with you in the cocktail party and you said something that reminded me of my childhood, I might consider the conversation riveting even if you hadn’t intended to make that connection for me. In this way, art is more than just a one-way-street.
			</p><br>	
			<p class= "scroll-fadeinup-once hidden">
				There’s something undeniably special about that which we call art. It is inescapable, yet at the same time such a confusing concept to grasp. But most art has its unifying principles, through which it can be understood. If we analyze the context of the art, not only what it depicts or claims to depict, but also the historical, religious, scientific, and social movements of the time, we can get a better understanding of how and why these pieces came to be. If we think about artwork as an expression, a symptom of the artist, we can better understand where to look for meaning. Finally, in understanding that art is conversation, we can keep our minds open to new opportunities and new ways to understand the art, and ourselves.

			</p><br>
			<p class= "scroll-fadeinup-once hidden">
				Not all pieces of art are good. Not all pieces of art in museums are good. But each piece, each installation, each set was put there by someone, sometime, someplace. Each piece of art is an open invitation to connect, and possibly even resonate, with something, and someone, you never knew before.

				<h1>Back to the Bucket.</h1>
			</div>
			<p class= "scroll-fadeinup-once hidden">
				Hopefully this article has helped bring new perspectives with which to engage with art. I’d like to leave you where we began, two blackboards and a bucket.
			</p><br>
			<p class= "scroll-fadeinup-once hidden">
				As someone who, on a good day, would consider myself an artist (perhaps an art enthusiast), I find that the blackboards and buckets piece (<i>F.I.U. Blackboards</i>, Joseph Beuys) resonates with me on a number of levels. The piece, prominently displayed as part of the Hirshhorn’s exhibit “What Absence is Made of”, is an artist’s take on how to depict nothing. 
			</p><br>
			<p class= "scroll-fadeinup-once hidden">
				Think about that for a second. How on earth are you supposed to paint nothing, when the act of painting, by definition, is something? The piece consists of two planks, each painted black, and a bucket with a washcloth draped over it. Maybe the artist attempted to paint nothing, but realizing the futility of the effort, has stormed off in frustration, leaving his bucket behind? Never mind the bucket’s blatant symbolic connection with death (see: “kick the bucket”, “bucket list”), perhaps the most frightening incarnation of absence. 
			</p><br>
			<p class= "scroll-fadeinup-once hidden">
				Observing this, and other pieces, I was struck by the idea that the concept of absence had to be created- that in and of itself, the request for a piece about the substance of absence was something of a paradox. Yet the piece also slyly winks at fellow artists, indicating at the power of artists to depict the impossible, to create something that in itself should not, could not ever be created.  
			</p><br>
			<p class= "scroll-fadeinup-once hidden">
				I appreciate that piece not because I know the artist intended these things, nor because I think it depicts a subject photo-realistically, but because for a brief moment I connected with the piece he had created- I was in on the joke, in on the story, in on the thread that in some ways I had created myself. 
			</p><br>
			<p class= "scroll-fadeinup-once hidden">
				And maybe that’s the art in it. I’ll never know for sure, but intentional or unintentional, there’s something beautiful about the ability of the human mind to create, to explore, to express; such that even in the absence of beauty, we can make it, or find it...
			</p><br>
			<p class= "scroll-fadein hidden" style="text-align: center">
				Out of nothing at all.
